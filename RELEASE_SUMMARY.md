1. **`.github/workflows/release.yml`** - Automated release workflow
   - Triggers on version tags (v*.*.*)
   - Builds signed release APK
   - Creates GitHub Release
   - Attaches APK to release

2. **`.github/workflows/build.yml`** - Continuous Integration workflow
   - Triggers on push/PR to main
   - Builds debug APK
   - Runs tests
   - Uploads APK as artifact

## How It Works

### Automated Release Process

1. **Developer creates a version tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions automatically:**
   - Checks out the code
   - Sets up Java 17 and Gradle
   - Builds the release APK
   - Signs it with the provided keystore
   - Creates a GitHub Release
   - Attaches the signed APK

3. **Users can download:**
   - Visit the Releases page
   - Download the APK
   - Install on Android device

### Required Setup (One-time)

1. **Generate signing key** (use `setup-release.sh` or follow QUICK_START.md)
2. **Configure GitHub secrets:**
   - `SIGNING_KEY` - Base64 encoded keystore
   - `KEY_ALIAS` - Keystore alias
   - `KEY_STORE_PASSWORD` - Keystore password
   - `KEY_PASSWORD` - Key password

   |                         |                        |
   |                         |----[Download APK]----->|
   |                         |                        |
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Keystore Management:**
   - ✅ Never commit to git
   - ✅ Store in secure location
   - ✅ Create backup copy
   - ✅ Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD

2. **Password Security:**
   - ✅ Use strong passwords
   - ✅ Store in password manager
   - ✅ Never hardcode in files
   - ✅ Use GitHub Secrets

3. **Code Security:**
   - ✅ ProGuard/R8 enabled for release
   - ✅ Remove debug logs
   - ✅ Validate user inputs
   - ✅ Keep dependencies updated

## Testing

### Test the Workflow

1. **Test without creating release:**
   ```bash
   # Run build workflow manually
   # Go to: Actions → Build APK → Run workflow
   ```

2. **Test with pre-release:**
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0-beta
   git push origin v0.1.0-beta
   # Mark as pre-release in GitHub
   ```

3. **Production release:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Workflow fails - secrets not found**
   - Solution: Verify all 4 secrets are added in GitHub Settings

2. **APK not signed**
   - Solution: Check secret values are correct

3. **Build fails**
   - Solution: Check Actions logs for specific error

4. **Can't install APK**
   - Solution: Enable "Install from Unknown Sources" in Android settings

5. **Workflow fails - "Resource not accessible by integration"**
   - Solution: The workflow needs write permissions. This has been fixed by adding `permissions: contents: write` to the workflow file. Pull the latest changes from the repository.

### Getting Help

- **Build issues:** Check `.github/workflows/` files
- **Release process:** See `RELEASE_GUIDE.md`
- **Quick setup:** See `QUICK_START.md`
- **App issues:** Check main documentation

## Next Steps for Repository Owner

1. **Set up signing (one-time):**
   ```bash
   ./setup-release.sh
   # Follow prompts and add secrets to GitHub
   ```

2. **Create first release:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Verify release:**
   - Check Actions tab for successful build
   - Check Releases page for APK
   - Download and test APK

4. **Share with users:**
   - Share release link
   - Update README with download instructions
   - Consider publishing to Play Store

## Success Criteria

✅ Automated APK building on tag push
✅ Signed release APK
✅ GitHub Release creation
✅ APK attachment to release
✅ Comprehensive documentation
✅ Security best practices
✅ Easy setup process
✅ Troubleshooting guides

## Conclusion

The eClock Android app now has a complete, automated release pipeline that:
